  students = pd.read_csv('students.csv')
                                      INITIAL EXPLORATION
  1. The provided dataframe (saved as students) includes the following variables/features:
address: the location of the student’s home ('U' for urban and 'R' for rural)
absences: the number of times the student was absent during the school year
Mjob: the student’s mother’s job industry
Fjob: the student’s father’s job industry
math_grade: the student’s final grade in math, ranging from 0 to 20
Use the pandas .head() method to inspect the first few rows of data.
//
print(students.head())                                            RESULT:
                                                              	address	absences	Mjob	    Fjob	    math_grade
                                                              0	U	      6	        at_home	  teacher	  6

                                                              2	U	      10	      at_home	  other	    10
                                                              3	U	      2	        health	  services	15
                                                              4	U	      4	        other	    other	    10
  2. Use the pandas .describe() method to print out summary statistics for all five features in the dataset. Inspect the output. Do more students live in urban or rural locations?
//

                                      SUMMARIZE A TYPICAL STUDENT GRADE
  3. Let’s start by trying to summarize the math_grade column. Calculate and print the mean value of math_grade.
//
print(students.math_grade.mean())                                RESULT:
                                                              	10.415189873417722

  4. Next, calculate and print the median value of math_grade. Compare this value to the mean. Is it smaller? larger?
//
print(students.math_grade.median())                              RESULT:
                                                              	11.0
  5. Finally, calculate and print the mode of the math_grade column. What is the most common grade earned by students in this dataset? How different is this number from the mean and median?
//
print(students.math_grade.mode())                                RESULT:
                                                              	0    10
                                                              	dtype: int64

                                      SUMMARIZE THE SPREAD OF STUDENT GRADES

  6. Next, let’s summarize the spread of student grades. Calculate and print the range of the math_grade column.
//
math_range = students.math_grade.max() - students.math_grade.min()
print(math_range)                                                RESULT:
                                                              	20
  7. Calculate and print the standard deviation of the math_grade column. About two thirds of values fall within one standard deviation of the mean. What does this number tell you about 
how much math grades vary?
//
print(students.math_grade.std())                                 RESULT:
                                                              	4.5814426109978434 The standard deviation is ~ 4.6, the average grade is ~ 10.4. Two thirds of students are earning 
                                                              	grades between 5.8 (10.4-4.6) and 15 (10.4+4.6).
  8. Finally, calculate the mean absolute deviation of the math_grade column. This is the mean difference between each students’s score and the average score.
//
print(students.math_grade.mad())                                 RESULT:
                                                              	3.4289889440794745

                                      VISUALISE THE DISTRIBUTION OF STUDENT GRADES
  9. Now that we’ve summarized student grades using statistics for central tendency and spread, let’s visualize the distribution using a histogram. Use the seaborn histplot() function 
to create a histogram of math_grade.
Note that we’ve provided code to show and clear each plot using:
plt.show()
plt.clf()
This ensures that the plots don’t get layered on top of each other. Make sure that you add your code to call sns.histplot() above plt.show().
//
sns.histplot(x='math_grade', data=students)
plt.show()
plt.clf()
  10. Another way to visualize the distribution of a quantitative variable is using a box plot. Use the seaborn boxplot() function to create a boxplot of math_grade. Make sure to add 
this code after the first call to plt.clf() from the above plot and before the second call to plt.show().
//
sns.boxplot(x='math_grade', data=students)
plt.show()
plt.clf()
