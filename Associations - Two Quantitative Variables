                                      INTRODUCTION
  1. The dataset described above has been saved for you as a pandas dataframe named housing. Use the .head() method to print the first 10 rows and inspect some more of the data. 
What are some other quantitative variables that might be related to each other?
//
print(housing.head(10))                                 RESULT:
                                                      	price	  type	      sqfeet	beds	baths	  lat	        long

                                      SCATTER PLOTS
  2. The housing data has been saved for you as a dataframe named housing in script.py. Create a scatter plot to see if there is an association between the number of bedrooms (beds) 
and the area (sqfeet) of a rental. Use Number of Bedrooms for the x-axis of your scatter plot. Do you think these variables are associated? If so, is the relationship what you expected?
//
plt.scatter( x = housing.beds, y = housing.sqfeet)
plt.xlabel('Number of Bedrooms')
plt.ylabel('Area(Square Feet')
plt.show()

                                      EXPLORING COVARIANCE
  3. Use the cov() function from NumPy to calculate the covariance matrix for the sqfeet variable and the beds variable. Save the covariance matrix as cov_mat_sqfeet_beds.
  4. Print out the value stored in the variable cov_mat_sqfeet_beds.
//
cov_mat_sqfeet_beds = np.cov(housing.sqfeet, housing.beds)
print(cov_mat_sqfeet_beds)                              RESULT:
                                                      [[110669.     228.2]
                                                       [   228.2      0.7]]
  5. Look at the covariance matrix you just printed and find the covariance of sqfeet and beds. Save that number as a variable named cov_sqfeet_beds.
//
cov_sqfeet_beds = 228.2

                                      CORRELATION PAT I
  6. Use the pearsonr function from scipy.stats to calculate the correlation between sqfeet and beds. Store the result in a variable named corr_sqfeet_beds and print out the result. 
How strong is the linear association between these variables?
//
corr_sqfeet_beds, p = pearsonr(housing.sqfeet, housing.beds)
print(corr_sqfeet_beds)                                 RESULT:
                                                      0.8060022524416223
  7. Generate a scatter plot of beds and sqfeet again. Does the correlation value make sense?
//
plt.scatter(x = housing.beds, y = housing.sqfeet)
plt.xlabel = 'Number of beds'
plt.ylabel = 'Square feet of the Apartment'
plt.show()

                                      CORRELATION PAT II
  8. A simulated dataset named sleep has been loaded for you in script.py. The hypothetical data contains two columns:
hours_sleep: the number of hours that a person slept
performance: that personâ€™s performance score on a physical task the next day
Create a scatter plot of hours_sleep (on the x-axis) and performance (on the y-axis). What is the relationship between these variables?
//
plt.scatter(x = sleep.hours_sleep, y = sleep.performance)
plt.show()                                              RESULT:
                                                      Linear dependance represented in a Parabolic function appears (upside down - where a<0 (ax^2 + bx +c)).
  9. Calculate the correlation for hours_sleep and performance and save the result as corr_sleep_performance. Then, print out corr_sleep_performance. Does the correlation accurately 
reflect the strength of the relationship between these variables?
//
corr_sleep_performance, p = pearsonr(sleep.hours_sleep, sleep.performance)
print(corr_sleep_performance)                           RESULT:
                                                      The correlation result is only ~0.28 which does not reflect an existing strong relationship even though the parabolic line 
                                                      is very easy and clear to indicate in the appeared graph.

                                      REVIEW
As a final exercise, a new dataset named penguins has been uploaded for you in script.py. This dataset contains various measurements for a sample of penguins. To practice the skills 
learned in this lesson, here are some things to try:
  1. Inspect the first few rows of data.
//
print(penguins.head())                                   RESULT:  
                                                        species	bill_length_mm	bill_depth_mm	flipper_length_mm	body_mass_g	sex
                                                      0	Adelie	39.1	          18.7	        181.0	3750.0	    male
                                                      1	Adelie	39.5	          17.4	        186.0	3800.0	    female
                                                      2	Adelie	40.3	          18.0	        195.0	3250.0	    female
                                                      3	Adelie	36.7	          19.3	        193.0	3450.0	    female
                                                      4	Adelie	39.3	          20.6	        190.0	3650.0	    male
  2. Create a scatter plot of flipper length (flipper_length_mm) and body mass (body_mass_g).
//
plt.scatter(x = penguins.body_mass_g, y = penguins.flipper_length_mm)
plt.xlabel ("The mass of the penguin's body")
plt.ylabel ("The length of the penguin's flipper")
plt.show()
  3. Inspect your plot. What is the relationship between these variables?
//
+- Linear 
  4. Calculate the covariance for these two variables.
//
cov_peng_mass_flip_len = np.cov(penguins.body_mass_g, penguins.flipper_length_mm)
print("The covariance matrix: ")
print(cov_peng_mass_flip_len)                           RESULT:
                                                      [[648372.5   9852.2]
                                                      [  9852.2    196.4]]
print("The covariance:")
print(cov_peng_mass_flip_len[1][0])                     RESULT:
                                                      The covariance:
                                                      9852.191649480805
  5. Calculate the correlation for these two variables. Does this number make sense given the plot you created?
//
corr_peng_mass_fl_leng, p = pearsonr(penguins.body_mass_g, penguins.flipper_length_mm)
print("The correlation between penguin's mass and his flipper length: ")
print(corr_peng_mass_fl_leng)                           RESULT:
                                                      The correlation between penguin's mass and his flipper length: 
                                                      0.8729788985653615
                                                      Makes all the sense :) The heavier the penguin the longer the flipper <3
