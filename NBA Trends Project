                                      ANALYZING RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN QUANT ANDCATEGORICAL
  1. 
In script.py, the data has been subsetted for you into two smaller datasets: games from 2010 (named nba_2010) and games from 2014 (named nba_2014). To start, letâ€™s focus on the 2010 data.
Suppose you want to compare the knicks to the nets with respect to points earned per game. Using the pts column from the nba_2010 DataFrame, create two series named knicks_pts_10 
(fran_id = "Knicks") and nets_pts_10(fran_id = "Nets") that represent the points each team has scored in their games.
//
knicks_pts_10 = nba_2010.pts[nba_2010.fran_id == 'Knicks']
print(knicks_pts_10.head())                                    RESULT:
                                                                pts
