                        ASSESSING VARIABLE TYPES

  1. The movies dataframe is composed of the television shows and movies hosted on the Netflix platform in 2019. Print the first five rows of the dataframe using the .head() method.
//
print(movies.head(5))                  RESULT:
                                                Unnamed: 0	type	    title	            country	        release_year	  rating	  duration

  2. The rating variable describes the Motion Picture Association Film Rating Board rating for each film and the TV Parental Guidelines Monitoring Board rating for each television show. 
We have consolidated the ratings for simplicity. Inspect the first five rows that were just printed out from the .head() method. Identify whether the rating variable is quantitative or
categorical and assign the value of 'numerical' or 'categorical' to a variable called rating_variable_type.
//
rating_variable_type = 'categorical'
print(rating_variable_type)            RESULT:  'categorical'

                        CATEGORICAL VARIABLES

  3. Run the code in the workspace to view the first five rows of the movies dataframe.
//
print(movies.head(5))                  RESULT:
                                                show_id	  type	    title	                country	        release_year	rating	  duration	  cast_count	  est_budget (USD)

  4. Print the unique values of the country column to assess its variable type.
//
print(movies['country'].unique())      RESULT:
                                                ['United States' 'South Africa' nan 'India'
                                                'United States, Ghana, Burkina Faso, United Kingdom, Germany, Ethiopia'
                                                'United Kingdom' 'Germany, Czech Republic' 'Mexico' 'Turkey' 'Australia'
                                                'United States, India, France' 'Finland' 'China, Canada, United States'
                                                ...]
  5. Identify whether the country column is ordinal or nominal and assign the value of country_variable_type to either 'ordinal', 'nominal', or 'binary'.
//
country_variable_type = 'nominal'

                        QUANTITATIVE VARIABLES

  6. Run the code in the workspace to view the first five rows of the movies dataframe.
//
print(movies.head(5))                  RESULT:
                                                show_id	  type	    title	                country	        release_year	rating	  duration	  cast_count	  est_budget (USD)

                                              2	s3	      TV Show	  Ganglands	            nan	            2021	        TV-MA    	1 Season	  9.0	          5719277
                                              3	s4	      TV Show	  Jailbirds New Orleans	nan	            2021	        TV-MA	    1 Season	  nan	          7881417
                                              4	s5	      TV Show	  Kota Factory	        India	          2021	        TV-MA	    2 Seasons	  8.0	          27387486
  7. The release_year variable expresses the year that a movie or television show was originally released. Inspect the first five rows of the dataset that were printed, and identify 
whether this column is discrete or continuous. From this inspection, assign the value of release_year_variable_type to either 'discrete' or 'continuous'.
//
release_year_variable_type = 'discrete'
print(release_year_variable_type)                  RESULT: discrete
  8. The cast_count variable describes how many cast members are in the show. Inspect the first five rows of the printed dataset, and identify whether this column is discrete or continuous.
From this inspection, assign the value of cast_count_variable_type to either 'discrete' or 'continuous'.
//
cast_count_variable_type = 'discrete'
print(cast_count_variable_type)                    RESULT: discrete

  9. Run the code in the workspace to view the first five rows of the movies dataframe.
//
print(movies.head(5))                  RESULT:
                                                show_id	  type	    title	                country	        release_year	rating	  duration	  cast_count	  est_budget (USD)
                                              0	s1	      Movie	    Dick Johnson Is Dead	United States	  2020	        PG-13	    90 min	    nan	          11959075
                                              1	s2	      TV Show	  Blood & Water	        South Africa	  2021	        TV-MA    	2 Seasons	  19.0	        9436627
                                              2	s3	      TV Show	  Ganglands	            nan	            2021	        TV-MA    	1 Season	  9.0	          5719277
                                              3	s4	      TV Show	  Jailbirds New Orleans	nan	            2021	        TV-MA	    1 Season	  nan	          7881417

  10. Check the data types of all the numerical variables in the movies DataFrame with .dtypes. Make sure to print the data types to the console. Are there any mismatches between 
data types and variable types?
//
print(movies.dtypes)                  RESULT:
                                                                	0
                                              show_id	          object
                                              type	            object
                                              title	            object
                                              country	          object
                                              release_year	    int64
                                              rating	          object
                                              duration	        object
                                              cast_count	      float64
                                              est_budget (USD)	int64
  11. Try to change the cast_count variable to an integer of type int64. This will cause an error - that is OK! We expect there to be an error here. As long as the check mark on the 
left of the screen turns green, you’ve done it correctly. If we didn’t check for null values in advance, this error message might be the first time we find out that we have null values.
//
movies['cast_count'] = movies['cast_count'].astype('int64')
                                      RESULT: ERRORR
  12. Turns out we have to fill in the missing values. We actually don’t have a good way to know how many people are in each movie, so we will fill in the missing values with 0. 
We know that no movie has zero cast members, so this will logically be very odd, but will allow us to preserve the integrity of the data while converting the values. First, uncomment 
the line of code that replaces the null values with 0. (movies['cast_count'].fillna(0, inplace = True)) Note that it is above the line of code you just wrote. Then, re-run the code.
//
movies['cast_count'].fillna(0, inplace = True)
print(movies.head(5))                  RESULT:

  13. Now check the data types again and be sure they match what you expected.
//
print(movies.dtypes)                  RESULT:
                                                                	0

  16. Decide which variables you are going to change. We decided that title must be changed. Make a list of all the variables you plan to change in the change variable. It is ok 
if title is the only one you want to change. Open the Hint to check your logic.
//
Country may also be changed, BUT:
title is best represented by a string since we might want to perform string operations on it.
type, country, and rating are all codes, so they can remain as objects. However, if we needed to standardize them (i.e., make them all lowercase), they would need to be strings.
  17. Change the title variable to the "string" data type.

                        THE PANDAS CATEGORY DATA TYPE

GIVEN:
import codecademylib3
# Import pandas with alias
import pandas as pd
# Import dataset as a Pandas Dataframe
movies = pd.read_csv('netflix_movies.csv')
# View the first five rows of the dataframe
print(movies.head())
  20. Run the code in the workspace to print the first five rows of the movies DataFrame along with the unique values of the rating column.
//
print(movies.head(5))                  RESULT:

  21. Change the data type of the rating variable to categorical. Set an order of [‘NR’, ‘G’ , ‘PG’, ‘PG-13’, ‘R’].
//
movies['rating'] = pd.Categorical(movies['rating'],['NR', 'G' , 'PG', 'PG-13', 'R'], ordered=True)
                                      RESULT: [5 rows x 9 columns]
                                              ['PG-13' 'R' 'PG' 'G' 'NR']
  22. Check the new order of the categories with .unique(). Make sure to print the output.
//
print(movies['rating'].unique())
                                      RESULT: [PG-13, R, PG, G, NR]
                                              Categories (5, object): [NR < G < PG < PG-13 < R]
