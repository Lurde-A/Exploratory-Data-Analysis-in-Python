                        ASSESSING VARIABLE TYPES

  1. The movies dataframe is composed of the television shows and movies hosted on the Netflix platform in 2019. Print the first five rows of the dataframe using the .head() method.
//
print(movies.head(5))                  RESULT:
                                                Unnamed: 0	type	    title	            country	        release_year	  rating	  duration
                                              0	0	          Movie	    Norm of the ...	  United States	  missing	        PG	      91.071
                                              1	1	          Movie	    Jandino: Wha...	  United Kingdom	2016	          R	        94.516
                                              2	2	          TV Show	  Transformers...	  United States	  2013	          G	        1.127
                                              3	3	          TV Show	  Transformers...	  United States	  2016	          TV-14	    1.6869999999999998
                                              4	4	          Movie	    #realityhigh...	  United States	  2017	          TV-14	    99.248
  2. The rating variable describes the Motion Picture Association Film Rating Board rating for each film and the TV Parental Guidelines Monitoring Board rating for each television show. 
We have consolidated the ratings for simplicity. Inspect the first five rows that were just printed out from the .head() method. Identify whether the rating variable is quantitative or
categorical and assign the value of 'numerical' or 'categorical' to a variable called rating_variable_type.
//
rating_variable_type = 'categorical'
print(rating_variable_type)            RESULT:  'categorical'

                        CATEGORICAL VARIABLES

  3. Run the code in the workspace to view the first five rows of the movies dataframe.
//
print(movies.head(5))                  RESULT:
                                                show_id	  type	    title	                country	        release_year	rating	  duration	  cast_count	  est_budget (USD)
                                              0	s1	      Movie	    Dick Johnson Is Dead	United States	  2020	        PG-13	    90 min	    nan	          11959075

                                              4	s5	      TV Show	  Kota Factory	        India	          2021	        TV-MA	    2 Seasons	  8.0	          27387486
  4. Print the unique values of the country column to assess its variable type.
//
print(movies['country'].unique())      RESULT:
                                                ['United States' 'South Africa' nan 'India'
                                                'United States, Ghana, Burkina Faso, United Kingdom, Germany, Ethiopia'
                                                'United Kingdom' 'Germany, Czech Republic' 'Mexico' 'Turkey' 'Australia'
                                                'United States, India, France' 'Finland' 'China, Canada, United States'
                                                ...]
  5. Identify whether the country column is ordinal or nominal and assign the value of country_variable_type to either 'ordinal', 'nominal', or 'binary'.
//
country_variable_type = 'nominal'

                        QUANTITATIVE VARIABLES

  6. Run the code in the workspace to view the first five rows of the movies dataframe.
//
print(movies.head(5))                  RESULT:
                                                show_id	  type	    title	                country	        release_year	rating	  duration	  cast_count	  est_budget (USD)
                                              0	s1	      Movie	    Dick Johnson Is Dead	United States	  2020	        PG-13	    90 min	    nan	          11959075

  7. The release_year variable expresses the year that a movie or television show was originally released. Inspect the first five rows of the dataset that were printed, and identify 
whether this column is discrete or continuous. From this inspection, assign the value of release_year_variable_type to either 'discrete' or 'continuous'.
//
release_year_variable_type = 'discrete'
print(release_year_variable_type)                  RESULT: discrete
  8. The cast_count variable describes how many cast members are in the show. Inspect the first five rows of the printed dataset, and identify whether this column is discrete or continuous.
From this inspection, assign the value of cast_count_variable_type to either 'discrete' or 'continuous'.
//
cast_count_variable_type = 'discrete'
print(cast_count_variable_type)                    RESULT: discrete
